# OBS Stream Overlays

A collection of GPU-accelerated PixiJS 8 overlays and animated screens for use as OBS Browser Sources. All screens render with a transparent background and are designed to layer over your stream.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18+
- npm (comes with Node)

### Install & Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The dev server starts at **http://localhost:8080**

Go to **http://localhost:8080/map.html** to see an index of all available screens. Click any screen to view it, or navigate directly to its URL (see below).

Each screen has its own URL — navigate to one directly:

```
http://localhost:8080/main-web-cam-border.html
http://localhost:8080/planet.html
http://localhost:8080/rain.html
# etc.
```

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

Output goes to `dist/`. You can then serve it with any static file server and point OBS to those URLs.

## Adding a Screen to OBS as a Browser Source

### Step 1 — Add a Browser Source

1. In OBS, click **+** in the **Sources** panel.
2. Select **Browser**.
3. Give it a name (e.g. `Webcam Border`).

### Step 2 — Configure the Browser Source

| Setting                                       | Value                                                                  |
| --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **URL**                                       | `http://localhost:8080/main-web-cam-border.html` (or whichever screen) |
| **Width**                                     | Match your canvas resolution (e.g. `1920`)                             |
| **Height**                                    | Match your canvas resolution (e.g. `1080`)                             |
| **Custom CSS**                                | Leave blank — transparency is built in                                 |
| **Shutdown source when not visible**          | Optional — saves GPU when scene is hidden                              |
| **Refresh browser when scene becomes active** | Recommended for animated screens                                       |

> All screens already set `background: transparent` and `backgroundAlpha: 0` in PixiJS, so you do **not** need to enable "Allow transparency" separately in OBS — it works automatically with browser sources.

### Step 3 — Layer It Correctly

- Place the browser source **above** your Webcam/Video Capture source in the sources list.
- Use OBS **Filters** on your webcam source if you need to crop or color-correct it independently.

## Making Your Webcam Feed Circular (Image Mask)

Camera border screens are designed to frame a circular or rounded webcam feed. To make the webcam itself circular in OBS:

### Method A — Image Mask Filter (Recommended)

1. Select your **Video Capture Device** (webcam) source.
2. Click the **Filters** button (or right-click → Filters).
3. Click **+** → **Image Mask/Blend**.
4. Set **Type** to `Alpha Mask (Alpha Channel)`.
5. Click **Browse** and select a circular mask PNG.

**The mask PNG** should be a white-filled circle on a transparent (or black) background, sized to match your webcam crop. A 1000×1000 or 512×512 white circle on transparency works well.

You can create one quickly in any image editor (GIMP, Photoshop, Figma) — draw a circle, fill white, export as PNG with transparency. Free ones are also available by searching "OBS circular webcam mask PNG".

### Method B — Crop + Corner Rounding (OBS 30+)

1. Select your webcam source.
2. Right-click → **Filters** → **+** → **Crop/Pad**.
3. Crop to a square (equal width/height).
4. Add another filter: **Round Corners** (available in OBS 30+).
5. Set radius to `50%` for a perfect circle.

### Aligning the Circular Feed with a Camera Border Screen

- Use the **Edit Transform** dialog (right-click → Transform → Edit Transform) to position and scale the webcam source.
- The camera border screens (e.g. `main-web-cam-border.html`, `hexcam.html`) are centered and sized relative to the full canvas — position your circular webcam in the center of the scene at roughly `400×400` to `600×600` px depending on the border design.
- Toggle the browser source visibility while adjusting to see the frame alignment.

## Dev Notes

- **Tech stack:** PixiJS 8, TypeScript, Vite, Motion, Pixi Sound
- **Color theme:** Catppuccin Mocha throughout
- **All screens** are transparent-background by default — no chroma key needed
- Adding a new screen: create `src/MyScreen.ts` + `my-screen.html`, register the HTML entry in `vite.config.ts`
