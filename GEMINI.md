# OBS Effects: PixiJS Overlay Project

This project is a collection of high-performance, GPU-accelerated visual overlays and backgrounds designed for use as OBS Browser Sources. It leverages **PixiJS 8** and **TypeScript** to create dynamic, transparent, and responsive visuals.

## Core Technologies
- **PixiJS 8:** Used for WebGL/WebGPU rendering. We utilize the Ticker for delta-time based animations, Graphics for procedural shapes, and Containers for scene management.
- **Vite:** Multi-page application (MPA) build system. Each effect has its own `.html` entry point.
- **TypeScript:** Strict typing for all simulation logic and engine components.
- **AssetPack:** Optimized asset processing for textures and fonts.

## Overlay Categories
The project distinguishes between three primary use cases for OBS:

1.  **Webcam Borders:** Animated frames designed to wrap around a camera feed (often circular or rounded). Examples: `hexcam.html`, `wavecam.html`, `main-web-cam-border.html`.
2.  **Full Screen Overlays:** Transparent layers that sit *above* content, providing HUD elements, ambient particles, or interactive effects. Examples: `atom.html` (when used as an overlay), `matrix-dots.html`, `rain.html`.
3.  **Full Screen Backgrounds:** Opaque or dense simulations intended to serve as the bottom-most layer of a scene. Examples: `background.html`, `topo-landscape.html`, `galaxy-bg.html`, `voronoi-stippling.html` (Digital Organism).

## Color Palette: Catppuccin Mocha
We strictly adhere to the **Catppuccin Mocha** palette for a consistent, professional "hacker" aesthetic across all screens.

| Label | Hex | Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Base** | `0x1e1e2e` | Primary background color |
| **Surface0** | `0x313244` | Grid lines, subtle UI elements |
| **Text** | `0xcdd6f4` | Primary labels |
| **Subtext** | `0xa6adc8` | Secondary info labels |
| **Mauve** | `0xcba6f7` | Primary accent / magic |
| **Blue** | `0x89b4fa` | Tech / electricity |
| **Sapphire** | `0x74c7ec` | Water / cold |
| **Sky** | `0x89dceb` | Highlights |
| **Teal** | `0x94e2d5` | Active states |
| **Green** | `0xa6e3a1` | Success / nature |
| **Yellow** | `0xf9e2af` | Warnings / energy |
| **Peach** | `0xfab387` | Warm accents |
| **Red** | `0xf38ba8` | Danger / hot |

## Development Workflow
To add a new screen:
1.  **Screen Logic:** Create a class extending `Container` in `src/app/screens/`.
2.  **Entry Point:** Create a `.ts` file in `src/` to initialize the engine and show the screen.
3.  **HTML:** Create a `.html` file in the root linking to the `.ts` entry point.
4.  **Vite Config:** Register the new `.html` file in the `input` section of `vite.config.ts`.

## Engineering Standards
- **Performance:** Avoid object allocation in `update()` loops. Reuse `Graphics` objects or use `ParticleContainer` for large counts.
- **Transparency:** All screens should default to `backgroundAlpha: 0` unless specifically intended as an opaque background.
- **Responsiveness:** Implement the `resize(w, h)` method to ensure visuals scale correctly to OBS canvas resolutions.
- **Lifecycle Simulations:** For "living" backgrounds (e.g., Voronoi Stippling), use staggered initial ages and long lifespans (30s+) to avoid synchronized "mass death" events and maintain a calm ambient flow.
